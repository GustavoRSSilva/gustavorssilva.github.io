<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce a time ago a company based in London contacted me, they liked my curriculum and wanted to to complete a test in order to showcase my coding skills. They wanted me to create a Rock paper scissors game in angular.</p>

And so i <a href="https://github.com/GustavoRSSilva/rock-paper-scissors-the-game" target="\_blank">did</a>... and they never contacted me back.

There are many reasons why a company does not reply, this post is not about that, but looking back there are a lot more things that i could have done to showcase my coding skill.
