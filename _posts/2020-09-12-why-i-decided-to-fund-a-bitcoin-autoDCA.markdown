<!-- Intro -->

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t has been two years since I last wrote a blog post, a lot of things have changed, I left AppCoins to join the BMW DLT team.</p>

<!-- 2017/18 Ico bubble -->
The 2017/18 Crypto bull run left a sour taste, for one side I got to learn a new tecnology, on the other I felt as if nothing big came out of it. Bitcoin and Ethereum were leading the way, making it seem like both projects were the future and the ones to bet on. Bitcoin, on one side, was the stable project, it had just released the lightning network and kept its premise of being a store of value, like it had been from the past 8 years. As for Ethereum, the project was everywhere, creating a token for everything and everybody, from tokens that you could use to <a href="https://dentacoin.com/" target="\_blank">go the dentist</a>, to tokens that could be used to purshase online courses, solar energy, etc. If you are reading this and do not those tokens, do not worry, they went no where.

<!-- Bitcoin is a store of value -->
The only case that still holds today us Crypto currency as a store of value. Bitcoin is the new gold.

<!-- Conclusion -->
I have since stopped betting on everycoin in the hopes that it will dethrone Bitcoin and started to aquiring every monthe at least 100â‚¬ worth of Bitcoin
