<!-- Intro -->

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>lockchain technology has been around for more than a decade. Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper in 2008 and released the first version of Bitcoin, Bitcoin-core, in 2009.</p>

While Bitcoin as grown considerably in the last 5 years, it is still small. With a market cap of $198 Billion USD, Bitcoin is still much small than Apple ($1,172 trillion Billion USD) or Microsoft ($1,000 Billion USD). I would like to make a case why everyone should be looking into Bitcoin as an alternative to conventional investment, with the following 10 points:

<!-- Reason 1 -->
1 - Bitcoin is best investment in the last 10 years. If you have invested 50 Euro worth of bitcoin in 2013, that would amount to 391409 EUR in 2020, with a return of 7,828.18%. Making Bitcoin, by far, the best investment long term.

Even of short term, bitcoin would be beating the market by a hide margin, just look into bitcoin year lows, to see how much it has risen every year.

<!-- Reason 2 -->
2 - It is independent of other assets.
Bitcoin is independent of other assets, since it is not related to anything else. Just like gold, Bitcoin value comes from its storage capabilities, the ability to transfer and receive without any third parties.
<!-- Reason 3 -->
3 - The majority of cryptocurrencies are attached to bitcoin
Unlike Bitcoin, most of the other cryptocurrencies are attacked in some way to Bitcoin. All Exchanges uses bitcoin as the main currency and track their growth as CryptoCurrency per Bitcoin. Most alt-coin tens to mimic Bitcoin in some way or another, but cannot reach the level of decentralisation, interest or Computation power. Up until today, no alt-coin managed to have a better yearly return than Bitcoin and most tend to dissapear in less than 12 months.
<!-- Reason 4 -->
4 - Hard to confiscate
Bitcoin is not controlled by a central bank, fully decentralized and unlike fiat, with crypto you are your own bank. No one can steal your bitcoin as long you are safe and keep a backup. The government cannot simply sieze your assets with little to no warning.
<!-- Reason 5 -->
5 - Micro strategy just purshaged 21.454 Bitcoin.
Micro strategy just made one of the biggest best ever on Bitcoin. This might cause a ripple effect making other asset management companies. It is an excelent time to buy bitcoin.
<!-- Reason 6 -->
6 - The limited supply
There will only be 21 Million Bitcoins ever created. It is a scarce asset, that will make it harder and harder to generate more bitcoin. There is not enought Bitcoins for every millionare in the world.
<!-- Reason 7 -->
7 - There is no central authority
One of the reasons other alt-coins fails is the centralization around the coin creator. Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and left once it gainned momentum.
<!-- Reason 8 -->
8 - The economy is on a brick of colapse
On 
<!-- Reason 9 -->
9 - It does not care about fiat currencies
<!-- Reason 10 -->
10 - Its the best store of value



<!-- Conclusion -->
